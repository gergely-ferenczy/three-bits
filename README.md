Three.js extensions and utilities

- Pointer and mouse event handling in 3D space, using (almost) the same
  interface as regular DOM events.
- Managing scene resources and efficient rendering
- Orbit, FPV and trackball controls with much more configurability than what is
  available in the Three.js examples.
- Utility functions for handling typical 3D operations.
